# Onboarding

All required information could be found on [Doctoral study](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/faculty/doctoral-study).
Make sure to look at the website page in German, because some information might change (the name of the chairperson of the board of examiners for doctoral awards, currently for computer science: Prof. Dr. Michael Granitzer).

## Steps.

1. Collect the following documents:
   - [Supervision agreement](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/fileadmin/dokumente/beschaeftigte/kommunikation_marketing/Webbilder/Zielgruppen/Nachwuchswissenschaftler/Supervision_Agreeement_20.12.2017.pdf)

   - An application for admission or the necessary declaration (available from the Dean's Office: dekanat@fim.uni-passau.de on request).

   - Certified copie of your Master certificate.

   - CV

3. Once these documents are collected, send them by post to:
   ```
    An den 
    Vorsitzenden des  
    Promotionsausschusses
    der Fakultät für Informatik und Mathematik
    der Universität Passau
    Innstraße 33
    94032 Passau
   ```

3. Wait on the conformation of your application (Normally per E-Mail from the dean's office).
